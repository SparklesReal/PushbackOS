## Dependencies

[NASM](https://www.nasm.us/) <br>
[QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/)

## How to run

Install dependencies (Both compiler and emulator can be changed in the compile script) <br>
Run compile.bat or compile.sh depending on host OS

## "Todo"

Almost everything needs to be rewritten/fixed as this no longer does any of the basic intented functions while compiling using compile.sh (this might be the scripts fault or the code being broken)
